### R code examples for a number of common data analysis tasks

These examples aim to show how a number of common data analysis tasks can be performed using the [R environment for statistical computing](http://www.r-project.org).
The focus is on basic statistical methods for the social and life sciences.
The examples assume a reader who is already familiar with the statistical underpinnings, and who knows when a particular analysis should be carried out.

The posts on this site were created automatically from within R, using a workflow that makes use of [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and either [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). For details, see this [page explaining the workflow](rerWorkflow.html). All examples are [available on github](https://github.com/dwoll/RExRepos) as R markdown, markdown, or plain R code files.

The examples mostly come from my [book](http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/dwoll/r/), and are currently bare-bones R code. They will be complemented with comments and short explanations over time.

Some methods within the intended scope of this repository are currently missing:

 - Cluster analysis
 - Canonical correlation analysis
 - Time series

Contributed examples are very welcome, please contact me if you would like to add your code to this repository.
